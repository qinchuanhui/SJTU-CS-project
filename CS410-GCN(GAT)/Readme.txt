If you want to create the ouput, just use " $ python test.py"
Then the ouput_518030910059.txt will be over written.

There may be some warning when you run the program which is caused by the version conflicts of libraies.
However, that doesn't matter, you can still get the true result.

I make sure all of my programs can run smoothly and the output score is 0.88931.
If there is anything wrong, please contact me at qinchuanhuiyulong@sjtu.edu.cn

Thanks a lot.
